## 😎 Fun Facts

- 🧠 I once had a document called **hacking_notes** from my early TryHackMe days — over 800+ lines before my system corrupted and I lost it all. That’s when I learned to back up everything.  
- 🤖 I’ve been curious about how things work since I was 8 or 9 — I started looking into Unity just to figure out how pressing "A" made me jump.  
- 🐍 I automate everything I can… I mean everything  
- 🎮 I’m a gamer. I play Roblox, COD, CS2, Storror Parkour Pro, BTD6, Hitman 3, Rocket League, and more.  
- 🗃️ Ill let you in on a small secret? I’ve always had folders like `pythonlife`, `jslife`, `bashlife`, `htmllife`, and `csslife` filled with categorized notes and projects — but those are private (of course).
